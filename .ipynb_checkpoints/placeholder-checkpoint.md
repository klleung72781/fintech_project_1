# Major Findings for Group Two

## This README file serves as a written summary of major findings. Included are headings for each major question asked of the Group Two data. Also, under each heading is a short description of what Group Two found and any relevant plots/charts/graphs.

## In the attempt to disprove the group of stated null hypotheses, Group Two claimed major findings as it discovered data. Group Two followed a methodology for the acquisition, cleaning, and leverage of data. This methodology is provided.

## Methodology (from Approach Slide of Presentation)

Collect Past Data.
Clean Data.
Analyze Data.
Chart and Organize Past Data.
Leverage Indicators and Indicator Data for Comparison of Data/Assessment of Hypothesis.
Form Interactive Dashboard with Indicators.
Determine Methodology for Predicting Future Real Estate Earnings.
Leverage Organized Data to Make Predictions for Earnings.

## During each step in the methodology, Group Two probed the process with a question and found a major finding as an anwer.



## Collect Past Data.
Group Two collected data that fit the context of the hypotheses. The main null hypothesis for this project is that investing in real estate ownership does not result in greater returns than investing in any combination of REITs or conventional stock indices. In the endeavor to find the ideal real estate market, there are at least two ancillary hypotheses. One ancillary hypothesis is that population density does not have any relationship with real estate property values. Another ancillary hypothesis is that median household income does not have any relationship with real estate property values. These three hypotheses served as the main questions to answer as Group Two collected data.

For real estate property data, Group Two found data from several sources, including census.gov, zillow.com, and quandl.com.

For data for Standard & Poor's 500 (500), REITs, and Vanguard, Group Two retrieved data from finance.yahoo.com.


## Clean Data.

As Group Two collected its data, Group Two constantly scrutinized the quality of its data. Occasionally, Group Two found data that did not fit expectations. One such finding was the anomalous price to rent ratios that had New York County (Manhattan) having a lower price to rent ratio than Queens County. In this cleaning stage, Group Two had to confront a major question. How does one manage data that does not make sense?

Group Two looked for significant changes in data entries, outliers, and anomalous data entries; Group Two exluded these entries.


## Analyze Data.

Group Two continued its data analysis as it collected and cleaned data. Throughout these processes, Group Two kept the focus on the questions and hypotheses. In this discrete data analysis step, Group Two considered questions about population, population density, and median household income.

Group Two considered how results aligned or conflicted with preconcieved notions and guesses.

## Chart and Organize Past Data.

After the collection and analysis of data, Group Two charted and organized the data. In this stage, Group Two wanted to have an understanding of returns of investment vehicles from the past to the current point. As Group Two charted and organized data, at least one question dominated the focus of the work. What are the returns from investment vehicles to this point?

## Leverage Indicators and Indicator Data for Comparison of Data/Assessment of Hypothesis.

Group Two was able to gather data for several categories. The data gathered includes data for household income by county. Also, gathered data includes population. For each of these two data categories, the unit is the US county. At this point, the main questions for Group Two shifted. How does the data appear visually? What are the US counties that have the both the highest household income and the greatest population density?

Group Two was able to provide a graphical map representation of household income and population density.

Slide Text Below
According to realtor.com, there may be volatility in several real estate markets in terms of increased buyer demand
(https://www.realtor.com/research/july-2020-data/).

Home sales have increased from July 2020, but at a lower magnitude
(https://www.zillow.com/research/daily-market-pulse-26666/).

National Association of Realtors states that “this past quarter… prices continued to rise, with 96% of the markets
showing home price appreciation (nar.realtor).


Is it worth it to invest in US real estate? How much money can one make by
investing in real estate (investment in real estate = buying a property to rent out)?

What makes an ideal real estate market for an investor?

How can we use what we have learned up to this point to find an ideal real estate
market?

How can we use what we have learned up to this point to predict earnings from an
investment in real estate?

What is a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT)? REIT = stock for real estate.

How does investing in real estate compare with investing in other investment
vehicles (Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), Stock Indices, etc.)?

How can we leverage what we have learned so far to predict the value of
investments?

We wish to apply recently acquired knowledge.

We wish to address presumptions about investing in real
estate.

We wish to form the foundation of a high value application
for a user (dashboard from indicators).

Hypothesis formed from the traditional idea that real estate is
a a stable investment that brings excellent long term returns.

Investing in real estate is smart because real estate is a
physical entity that one can leverage in case of a disaster
(i.e., loss of shelter).

Investing in real estate is a good idea because, as the
maxim states, “One thing that people aren’t building any
more of is land.”

No clear correlation between population density and income.

In terms of long term returns, it’s better to purchase physical real estate than in any set of stock indices; that is, investing in real estate will bring a greater return on investment than investing in any set of REITs, any one stock index, or in any collection of stock indices.
Given the best methodology to find the best real estate market, one can gain an excellent return on investment.
Does one gain more money by purchasing real estate or by investing?


Null Hypothesis: a million dollar investment in real estate will not bring a greater return than a million dollar investment in a set of major stock indices and/or REITs...

Important Lesson Learned… Decisions for finding and leveraging data influenced the scope of the project (could not include fundrise.com or roofstock.com because these fintech real estate companies had no data available).



Discover, document, discount, and drop aberrations.


Place data through planned processes (plotting, Monte Carlo, etc.).
Constant monitor for practical knowledge.
Always ask whether the data makes sense.
Important Lesson Learned… It is crucial to examine the data the entire way through the process, from collection, through tabulation, all the way to use.

Apply lessons from class.
Constantly examine charts and graphs for practical knowledge, patterns, and accord with hypotheses.
Always ask oneself whether the data makes any sense.


The User will be able to toggle views of US real estate market based on maps from selected real estate indicator.

Given identified real estate market, determine a methodology for calculation of future earnings.

Apply lessons from class.
Run Monte Carlo simulation.
Analyze predictions - just like in class.


Given identified real estate market, compare earnings.
Leverage Monte Carlo methodology.
Compare confidence intervals.

Interesting findings.

Interesting Findings
Implications of Findings
Current Status of Running Narrative


Important Principle - Data Determines the Project (refer to fundrise and roofstock fintech companies).
In general, up to this point, the data show that the most ideal markets are the biggest markets (NYC, LA, etc.).
Price to Rent Ratio and other indicator values fluctuate greatly - San Francisco goes from about twelve to fifty (https://smartasset.com/mortgage/price-to-rent-ratio-in-us-cities).
Discussion of Los Angeles and Chicago.

Additional research questions would deal with the international real estate markets (Tokyo, Hong Kong, London) and also national and international real estate market fluctuations during a pandemic (e.g. 1918 H1N1 influenza A pandemic).
Up to this point, findings support educated guesses.
With more time, Group Two could possibly look for relationships between real estate values and employment figures.

How should one invest a million dollars?
Up to this point, real estate looks like the best vehicle because of the traditional stability in owning property.
What are the top real estate markets?
Up to this point, large urban markets.
How much can investment in real estate bring you?
Still calculating...


ancillary hypothesis is that markets are hotter in areas of higher income and in higher population density...
